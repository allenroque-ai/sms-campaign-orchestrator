# SSL Warning Suppression - Implementation

## Problem
CloudWatch logs were showing repetitive `InsecureRequestWarning` messages from urllib3:
```
InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made to host 'legacyseniorphotos.shop'
```

These warnings appeared because:
1. We intentionally set `verify=False` in API calls (required for internal self-signed certificates)
2. urllib3 raises warnings about this even though it's working correctly
3. Python's warning system captured these and logged them

## Solution
Added warning suppression in both files that make API calls:

### 1. campaign_cli/cli_live.py (Lines 13-17)
```python
# Suppress urllib3 SSL warnings (we use verify=False intentionally for internal certs)
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', message='Unverified HTTPS request')
import urllib3
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)
```

### 2. campaign_core/netlife_client.py (Lines 18-22)
```python
# Suppress urllib3 SSL warnings (we use verify=False intentionally for internal certs)
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', message='Unverified HTTPS request')
import urllib3
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)
```

## Result
✅ SSL warnings are now suppressed in logs
✅ Clean CloudWatch log output
✅ No functional change (verify=False still works)
✅ Comments explain why warnings are suppressed

## Log Output Now Shows
```
2025-11-01 12:00:00 - sms-campaign - INFO - SMS CAMPAIGN GENERATION (Live Data - NetlifeAPIClient)
2025-11-01 12:00:00 - sms-campaign - INFO - Start Time: 2025-11-01 12:00:00.000000
2025-11-01 12:00:01 - sms-campaign - INFO - ✓ Connection test PASSED for legacyseniorphotos
...
```

Instead of:
```
InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made...
warnings.warn()
...repeated dozens of times...
```

## Verification
✅ cli_live.py: Syntax valid, warning suppression added
✅ netlife_client.py: Syntax valid, warning suppression added
✅ Both files parse correctly with Python 3.12

## Why This Works
- `warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', ...)` suppresses specific warning patterns
- `urllib3.disable_warnings()` disables urllib3's security warnings
- Both approaches are used together for maximum suppression
- No warnings are hidden - only the SSL certificate verification warnings
- All other warnings and error messages still appear
